A GUI for manipulating the Application menu of gnome 3, because it is not as easy as it should be.

Current State:
Main features are complete. You can add/remove/edit desktop entries! Does not support multi-language entry editing, as that is a very complex side of desktop entries that I really don't need.
Going to clean up the interface, and perhaps construct an Arch AUR package so I can just install it easily next time.

Fun Tips:
Pass in -h as a command line parameter to get help and additional instructions! 
-d allows you to specify a different entry directory.

The username will automatically be used to generate a path to /home/USERNAME, etc, so if your system is different for some reason, be sure to pass in the proper directory!
Report all bugs on this github page under "issues". Enjoy!
