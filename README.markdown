A GUI for manipulating the Application menu of Gnome 3, because it is not as easy as it should be.

To compile the code from source and run it, use the script:
./RUN

--or--

See the "Downloads" tab  for the latest binaries.

The username value in the system will automatically be used to generate a path to /home/USERNAME, etc, so if your system is different for some reason, be sure to pass in the proper directory!
Report all bugs on this github page under "issues". Enjoy!

Fun Tips:
Pass in -h as a command line parameter to get help and additional instructions! 
-d allows you to specify a different entry directory.
After you make a change, if it doesn't show up in the app menu, you might have made a mistake while entering the data, or you may have to restart the shell (Alt+F2, and enter "r" into the field).

Current State:
Main features are complete. You can add/remove/edit desktop entries! Does not support multi-language entry editing, as that is a very complex side of desktop entries that I really don't need.
